##Sales Analysis

The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

We started by cleaning our data. Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we moved on to data exploration. We explored 5 high level business questions related to our data:

  1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
  2. What city sold the most product?
  3. What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
  4. What products are most often sold together?
  5. What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

To answer these questions we walked through many different pandas & matplotlib methods.
